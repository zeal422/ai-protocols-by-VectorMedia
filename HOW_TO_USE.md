# � How to Use: AI Development Protocols (v2.3.0)

Master the "Zero-Error" workflow by utilizing the encapsulated intelligence of the `BRAIN/` directory.

---

## 1. ⚡ Quick Trigger: The Master Protocol
The `MASTER_PROTOCOL.md` is your AI's brain. To start any task with 100% protocol compliance, use the following trigger:

> **"Use BRAIN/MASTER_PROTOCOL.md to [your task here]..."**

**Example:**
> "Use BRAIN/MASTER_PROTOCOL.md to audit this login flow for security issues using SECAUDIT."

## 2. 🧠 Core Workflow (The 4-Phase Loop)
Every task follows a mathematically reliable path to zero errors:

1.  **Reconnaissance**: AI maps your tech stack and dependencies using `FULLINDEX`.
2.  **Strategic Planning**: AI drafts an `implementation_plan.md` using `MDAP` decomposition.
3.  **Atomic Execution**: AI performs tiny, verifiable edits ($p \to 1$).
4.  **Verification**: AI runs `scripts/validate-protocols.js` or unit tests to prove success.

## 3. 🛠️ Key Trigger Commands
Type these commands into your AI prompt to activate specialized "BRAIN" modules:

| Command | Protocol Module | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `FULLINDEX` | `codebase_indexing` | Mapping a new project / Understanding architecture. |
| `MDAP` | `mdap_protocol` | **High-Stakes Refactors.** Zero-error scaling laws. |
| `DEEPDIVE` | `debug_protocol` | Isolating the "Impossible" bug using the Scientific Method. |
| `SECAUDIT` | `security_audit` | OWASP Top 10 + AI-specific prompt injection checks. |
| `ULTRATHINK`| `moreFRONTend` | "Avant-Garde" UI/UX design and architecture. |
| `FULLSPEC` | `test_automation` | 100% test coverage for mission-critical logic. |

## 4. 📂 Directory Structure
Keep these folders in your project root for the AI to access:
- `/BRAIN`: Contains `MASTER_PROTOCOL.md` and all 15 specialized sub-protocols.
- `/docs`: Detailed scenarios, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides.
- `/scripts`: Validation tools to ensure protocol integrity.
- `/configurations`: Pre-configured rules for Cursor, Opencode, Cline, Kilocode, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, and VS Code.

## 🛡️ Zero-Error Rule (Red-Flagging)
If your AI starts to "circularly reason" or outputs > 700 tokens without a result, it is in a **correlated failure state**. 
**Action:** Stop, clear context, and re-trigger using `MDAP`.
