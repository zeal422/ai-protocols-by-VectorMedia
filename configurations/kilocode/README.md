# KiloCode Integration

To use these protocols with KiloCode:

1.  **Knowledge Base**: Upload the entire `---PROTOCOLS---by-VM` directory to your KiloCode knowledge base.
2.  **Context**: Ensure the AI has "Project Knowledge" enabled.
3.  **Triggers**: Use the the standard triggers like **`BIGPAPPA`** for audits or **`FULLINDEX`** for codebase mapping.
4.  **Performance**: KiloCode's long-context models excel with the optimized structure of these protocols, allowing for massive codebase audits with very few tokens wasted.
