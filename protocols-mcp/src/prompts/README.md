# Prompts Directory

## Purpose
This directory is reserved for future expansion to support custom system prompts and instructions that can be delivered alongside protocols.

## Planned Features
- Custom system prompts for AI assistants
- Context-specific instructions
- Protocol-specific guidance templates

## Current Status
This folder is currently empty but structured for future development. The MCP server currently delivers protocols via the standard tools (get_protocol, search_protocols, route_task, etc.).

## Future Implementation
When implemented, this could allow:
1. Protocol-specific AI system prompts
2. Custom instructions per protocol
3. Role-specific guidance
