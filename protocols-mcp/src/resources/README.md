# Resources Directory

## Purpose
This directory is reserved for future expansion to support additional resources like:
- Code examples
- Templates
- Configuration files
- Scripts
- Reference materials

## Planned Features
- Per-protocol code examples
- Implementation templates
- Boilerplate code
- Configuration samples
- Reference implementations

## Current Status
This folder is currently empty but structured for future development. The MCP server currently delivers protocol content as markdown files.

## Future Implementation
When implemented, this could provide:
1. Runnable code examples for each protocol
2. Project templates for common scenarios
3. Configuration boilerplates
4. Reference implementations in different languages
